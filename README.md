## üß† Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, I gained practical experience in:

- **Deploying CMS-based platforms** from local to production, including handling databases, hosting environments, and domain setups.
- **Debugging real-world issues**, such as redirection loops and module conflicts, which taught me about server behavior and CMS internals.
- **Customizing a production-ready e-commerce tool** to match the business needs of a client using code-level overrides.
- **Communicating with a client** to understand and implement exact specifications (UI changes, features, restrictions).
